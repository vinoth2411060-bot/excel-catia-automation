# Excel to CATIA Automation

## Problem Statement
In many engineering teams, critical design data such as dimensions, hole details, and part parameters are stored in Excel sheets. Engineers manually re-enter this data into CATIA to create 3D models, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Proposed Solution
This project automates the conversion of structured Excel data into parametric CATIA 3D models using a simple application interface. The system reads input values from Excel and automatically updates a predefined CATIA template.

## System Architecture
Excel File → Automation Script → CATIA Parametric Template → 3D Model Output

## Key Features
- Standardized Excel input template
- Automatic CATIA 3D model generation
- Parametric and reusable CATIA template
- Reduced manual effort and human errors
- Simple app-based execution

## Tech Stack
- CATIA (Parametric Modeling)
- Python (Automation & App)
- Excel (Input Data)
- GitHub (Version Control)

## Hackathon Scope
- Generate a single parametric 3D CATIA part from Excel input
- Demonstrate automation through a simple app interface

## Future Enhancements
- Batch processing for multiple parts
- Automatic 2D drawing generation
- Validation and error checking
- Integration with PLM / 3DEXPERIENCE
